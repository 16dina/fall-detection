# VisiAge Fall Detection System

This project is a Fall Detection System that utilizes computer vision techniques to detect falls in a video feed. The system integrates with Azure Blob Storage to store relevant information about the detected falls.

## Features

- **Real-time Fall Detection:** Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to analyze video frames and identify key points of a person, enabling real-time fall detection.
- **Azure Blob Storage Integration:** Stores information about detected falls, including timestamp, video blob name, and incident status, in Azure Blob Storage.
- **API Call to App Service:** Triggers an API call to an app service endpoint when a fall is detected, providing relevant information for further alerting and analysis.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Azure Blob Storage Configuration:**
   - Set up an Azure Storage account and create a container for storing fall information and video clips.
   - Update the `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` and `CONTAINER_NAME` variables in the code with your Azure Storage account details.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Execute the code file `fall_detection.py` to start the fall detection system.
   - The system will process the video feed, detect falls, and upload relevant information to Azure Blob Storage.

## Configuration

- **Yolo Model:**
  - The YOLO model file (`yolov8n-pose.pt`) is expected to be in the `yolo models/` directory.
  - You can replace the model file or adjust its location as needed.

- **Thresholds and Parameters:**
  - Adjust falling thresholds, time thresholds, and other parameters as needed for your specific use case. These are defined in the code under the "DEFINING VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS FOR FALLING/LAYING DOWN" section.

## Important Notes

- This project uses the FastAPI framework for handling HTTP requests. Ensure that FastAPI is suitable for your deployment environment.

- Make sure to customize the API endpoint (`url` variable in the `send_api_call` function) to match the endpoint of your app service.
